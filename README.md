Matte: A simple language with minimal syntax
============================================

Current status: PRE RELEASE
---------------------------

*Any features are subject to change, but a majority will stay intact as-is. Use at your own risk, as nothing is released yet.*


The Matte Language, compiler, and runtime are released under the MIT License, including 
but not limited to the pre-release form of all sources and components.




After being simultaneously amazed and frustrated with my 
favorite languages, I decided, for some reason, to make my own that 
incorporates pieces of my favorite languages with some... creative liberties.
