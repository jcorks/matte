Matte: A simple language with minimal syntax
============================================

Current status: PRE RELEASE
---------------------------

*Any features are subject to change, but a majority will stay intact as-is. Use at your own risk, as nothing is released yet.*



After being simultaneously amazed and frustrated with my 
favorite languages, I decided, for some reason, to make my own that 
incorporates pieces of my favorite languages with some... creative liberties.
