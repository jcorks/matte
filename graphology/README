This directory is for the MATTE_DEBUG__STORE feature of dumping 
all or some objects into graphology sources to allow visualization 
of the objects and their hierarchy in memory along with 
where the objects are sourced.

When using the creation functions 
matte_store_value_object_get_reference_graphology*, take the created 
nodes.js and edges.js and place them here. Then, host and run 
index.html
